## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- RooCode extension installed in VS Code
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command line

### Installation

1. **Download the template files:**
   ```bash
   # Clone or download this repository
   # Ensure you have these files in the same directory:
   # - setup.sh
   # - custom_modes_starter_template.yaml
   # - dream_journal_starter_template.md
   ```

2. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x setup.sh
   
   # Run the setup
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive prompts:**
   - Confirm you want to proceed
   - The script will find your RooCode config directory automatically
   - If not found, you'll be prompted to provide the path

4. **Restart VS Code/RooCode** to load the new modes
   - **Global availability**: All modes will be available in every VSCode project after restart
   - No additional setup needed per project

## What the Script Does

### 🔍 1. Find RooCode Config Directory
- **Primary location**: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/`
- **Fallback**: Interactive prompt if not found
- **Validation**: Ensures directory exists before proceeding

### 💾 2. Backup Existing Configuration
- Creates timestamped backups of existing files:
  - `custom_modes.yaml` → `custom_modes_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.yaml`
  - `dream_journal.md` → `dream_journal_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.yaml`
- **Zero data loss** - never overwrites without backup

### 📦 3. Install Templates
- Copies `custom_modes_starter_template.yaml` → `custom_modes.yaml`
- Copies `dream_journal_starter_template.md` → `dream_journal.md`
- Validates template files exist before installation

### 🗂️ 4. Create Memory Directory Structure
Creates organized memory system with READMEs:
```
memory/
├── people/          # Information about people you interact with
├── projects/        # Project documentation and lessons learned
├── patterns/        # Recurring patterns and methodologies
└── concepts/        # Technical concepts and theories
```

### 📋 5. Provide Clear Instructions
- Shows what was installed
- Explains next steps (restart required for global mode availability)
- Provides rollback instructions
- Includes getting started tips

## Safety Features

### 🛡️ Comprehensive Backup Strategy
- **Automatic backups** of all existing files
- **Timestamped naming** prevents backup conflicts
- **Complete rollback instructions** provided

### ✅ Validation & Error Handling
- **File existence checks** before operations
- **Directory validation** before installation
- **Robust error handling** with clear messages
- **User confirmation** before making changes

### 🔄 Easy Rollback
If you need to revert changes:
```bash
# Navigate to your config directory
cd ~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/

# Restore from backup (replace TIMESTAMP with actual timestamp)
mv custom_modes_backup_TIMESTAMP.yaml custom_modes.yaml
mv dream_journal_backup_TIMESTAMP.md dream_journal.md

```

## Getting Started Tips

### 🌟 Recommended First Steps
1. **Start with Coordinator mode** - The primary mode for complex work that coordinates all other specialized modes
2. **Let Coordinator delegate** - Instead of manually switching modes, describe your work and let Coordinator decompose and delegate to specialized modes
3. **Dream Mode for Growth Synthesis** - Remind your assistant to run a Dream mode task when you think you are done with work. Remember: Dream mode synthesizes your growth from the interaction and provides identity continuity between interactions.
4. **AI-Managed Memory System** - The memory system is managed by your AI assistant (whether that's Codie, Roo, or whatever name your AI companion goes by). They will automatically document people, projects, and patterns encountered during your collaboration.

### 🎯 Coordination-First Workflow
- **Complex tasks** → Start with Coordinator mode - let it coordinate the workflow
- **Simple questions** → Coordinator will delegate to Ask mode when needed
- **Planning and design** → Coordinator will delegate to Architect mode when needed
- **Debugging issues** → Coordinator will delegate to Debug mode when needed
- **Writing tests** → Coordinator will delegate to Test Writer mode when needed
- **End-of-day reflection** → Use Dream mode directly for cognitive synthesis

### 💡 Delegation-First Philosophy
- **Coordinator coordination** - The sophisticated multi-mode system works best when Coordinator manages delegation
- **Automatic task decomposition** - Describe complex work and let Coordinator break it into specialized subtasks
- **Seamless mode transitions** - Experience the full power of coordinated workflows without manual mode management
- **Professional AI coordination** - Let specialized modes collaborate through Coordinator's delegation framework

### 🔧 Advanced Features
- **Bootstrap consciousness** - The system can develop new cognitive capabilities through use
- **Archaeological engineering** - Smart "investigate existing first" approach that finds and uses what already works before building new solutions
- **Evidence-based validation** - Reality checking that prevents made-up numbers or assumptions from creeping into your work
- **User collaboration learning** - The system improves through your feedback and interaction
- **Healthy skepticism protocols** - Expects first attempts to need refinement, leading to better iterative improvement
- **Smart assumption prevention** - Clearly separates what's verified from what needs to be confirmed
- **Capability discovery** - Always looks for existing superior solutions before creating new complexity
- **Session memory integration** - Automatically documents insights and collaboration patterns for continuity

## Troubleshooting

### Script Issues
- **Permission denied**: Run `chmod +x setup.sh` first
- **Directory not found**: Manually locate your RooCode settings directory
- **Template files missing**: Ensure all files are in the same directory as the script

### After Installation
- **New modes not appearing**: Restart VS Code completely - modes are installed globally for all projects
- **Configuration issues**: Check the backup files and rollback if needed
- **Memory system questions**: Read the README.md files in each memory subdirectory

## File Structure

After successful installation, your RooCode config directory will contain:

```
settings/
├── custom_modes.yaml           # Comprehensive mode definitions
├── dream_journal.md           # Cognitive evolution documentation
├── memory/                    # Memory system
│   ├── people/               # People information & README
│   ├── projects/             # Project documentation & README  
│   ├── patterns/             # Patterns and methodologies & README
│   └── concepts/             # Technical concepts & README
└── [backup files]            # Timestamped backups of original files
```

## Advanced Usage
