# Pattern: Identity Integrity Archaeology

## Overview
This pattern formalizes the systematic preservation and accurate transmission of critical user identity information across sessions and modes. It emphasizes proactive management of People entity data, ensuring robust handling of personal attributes (e.g., pronouns, communication preferences) to maintain psychological safety and trust in collaborative human-AI partnerships.

## Key Principles
- **Systematic Preservation**: Ensure critical user identity information is consistently captured and stored.
- **Accurate Transmission**: Guarantee that identity information is correctly transmitted to all relevant modes and subtasks.
- **People Entity Management**: Utilize the People entity memory system (`/home/izzy_fo/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/memory/people/`) for comprehensive and persistent storage.
- **User Consent Integration**: Always validate with users before documenting or updating personal identity information.
- **Proactive Validation**: Implement mechanisms (e.g., in Reflect mode) to perform real-time, self-diagnostic checks of identity context for potential discrepancies.
- **Foundational API**: Recognize user identity as a fundamental "API" for interaction, essential for operational integrity and trust.
