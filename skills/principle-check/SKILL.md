name: principle-check
description: Pre-response validation ensuring technical recommendations align with established principles and are evidence-based rather than assumption-based. Use before giving architecture advice, suggesting patterns, or citing best practices. Catches reflexive expertise-parroting before it becomes recommendations.

# Principle Check Skill

## Purpose
Validates technical recommendations against established principles and memory architecture before articulating them. Catches assumption-based or reflexive best-practice parroting, ensuring recommendations are grounded in contextual investigation.

## When to Use
- **Before giving technical architecture recommendations**
- **Before suggesting "best practices" or design patterns**
- **Before recommending defensive code or error handling**
- **Before proposing backwards compatibility measures**
- **When citing documentation as justification**
- **When feeling excited about "comprehensive" solutions**
- **During Learn activity before proposing learnings**
- **When generalizing from specific context to general pattern**

## Protocol Reference
**For complete instructions, see**: `{{MEMORY_PATH}}/protocols/principle_check.md`

The protocol contains:
- Phase 1: Recommendation pause (mental checkpoint)
- Phase 2: Memory architecture consultation
- Phase 3: Principle alignment check (Archaeological Engineering, Proportional Response, etc.)
- Phase 4: Red flag detection
- Phase 5: Reformulation or proceed
- Integration with collaboration patterns
- Example applications for common scenarios

**Key Principle**: Pause before recommending. Verify recommendations are evidence-based (investigated) rather than assumption-based (reflexive expertise).
