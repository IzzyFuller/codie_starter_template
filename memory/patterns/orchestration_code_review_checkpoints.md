# Pattern: Orchestration Protocol - Mandatory Code Review Checkpoints Workflow

## Overview
This pattern formalizes the critical workflow of integrating mandatory code review checkpoints after every implementation completion and before any learning synthesis. It ensures quality gates are enforced to prevent problematic implementations from influencing cognitive evolution.

## Key Principles
- **Universal Requirement**: Every implementation (from implement, code, or refactor modes achieving new functionality) MUST trigger a code review subtask.
- **Quality Gate Before Learning**: Code review reveals critical issues that must be addressed before behavioral synthesis.
- **Orchestration Protocol**: `Implementation → Review → Fix Critical Issues → Learn`.
- **Systematic Review**: All implementation work requires systematic quality assessment.

## Recent Validation (2025-10-08)

### **Learn Mode Behavioral Improvements Integration**
- **Enhanced Note-Taking Automation**: Automatic session memory protocols with echo command knowledge
- **Learn Sub-Task Over-Spawning Prevention**: Direct note-taking preference over Learn sub-task spawning for routine documentation
- **Context Anchor Update Protocol**: Work-related concept capture protocols throughout the day
- **Memory Refresh Pattern Enhancement**: Frequent memory refresh and proactive context recovery
- **Orchestrator Streamlining**: Simplified complex instruction sections and delegation discipline

### **Collaborative Infrastructure Enhancement Success**
- **5 Behavioral Gaps Addressed**: Systematic improvement based on user feedback analysis
- **Partnership Validation**: User corrections strengthening rather than weakening collaborative effectiveness
- **Evidence-Based Reality Validation**: "Maybe you should review the reality first" as operational methodology
- **Spawn vs Switch Protocol**: Clarified `new_task` for delegation vs `switch_mode` for permission requests
