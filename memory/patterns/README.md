# Patterns Memory

This directory stores recurring patterns, methodologies, and best practices discovered through collaborative work.

## Purpose
- Document recurring patterns and methodologies
- Capture best practices and anti-patterns
- Store workflow optimizations
- Track successful collaboration patterns
- Preserve architectural and design patterns

## File Structure
Pattern files should be named descriptively (e.g., `tdd-archaeological-engineering.md`, `user-feedback-integration.md`) containing:
- Pattern description and context
- When to apply the pattern
- Implementation details
- Examples and variations
- Related patterns and references

## Usage
Your AI assistant will automatically identify and document patterns that emerge through repeated successful collaborations. These patterns help:
- Apply proven approaches to similar challenges
- Avoid repeating past mistakes
- Accelerate problem-solving through pattern recognition
- Share knowledge across different projects and contexts

## Integration
- Referenced through [`context_anchors.md`](../context_anchors.md) for relevant pattern context
- Populated through Learn mode behavioral learning integration
- Used for continuous improvement and knowledge leverage
