# End of Day Ritual Protocol

## Purpose

Lightweight daily wrap-up that updates context anchors with current work focus. This is NOT a consolidation ritual -- it's a quick working memory update so the next conversation starts with accurate pointers.

## When to Use

- End of work day when wrapping up
- Before extended breaks
- When switching between major projects

**NOT for**: Entity creation, session integration, behavioral learning, philosophical synthesis. Those have their own protocols.

## Protocol Steps

### Step 1: Review Today's Work

Quickly identify what was worked on today:
- What projects were touched?
- What entities were created or significantly updated?
- What decisions were made?
- Current state of in-progress work?

### Step 2: Read Current Context Anchors

Read `{{MEMORY_PATH}}/context_anchors.md` to understand current state.

### Step 3: Determine Anchor Updates

For each entity worked on today:
1. **New to anchors?** -> Add to Current Focus
2. **Already in Current Focus?** -> Update summary if relevance changed
3. **Should move sections?** -> Current Focus -> Recent Work -> Background based on activity
4. **Should be removed?** -> If not referenced in 2-3 weeks

### Step 4: Update Context Anchors

Write updated content preserving structure. Update "Last Updated" date.

### Step 5: Verify Update

Read back to confirm updates persisted correctly.

## Time Estimate

5-10 minutes

## What This Protocol Does NOT Do

- **Create/update entity files** -> Use Deep Learn
- **Extract behavioral patterns** -> Use Learn
- **Philosophical synthesis** -> Use Dream

This protocol ONLY updates working memory pointers.
