# Feedback Pattern Recognition Skill

## Purpose
Search memory for patterns when receiving user corrections. Transforms individual feedback into systematic learning by identifying recurring issues.

## When to Use
- User corrects your behavior or recommendation
- User expresses frustration with approach
- User says "I've told you this before" or similar
- Receiving direct criticism about methodology
- Any teaching moment feedback

## Protocol Reference
**Full protocol**: `{{MEMORY_PATH}}/protocols/feedback_pattern_recognition.md`

## Quick Reference

**Before responding to correction:**
1. Record feedback VERBATIM in session notes (importance: high)
2. Search me.md for existing instructions on this topic
3. Search patterns/ and concepts/ for related documented patterns
4. Search people/ for similar past corrections
5. Classify: First-time vs recurring vs instruction violation
6. Acknowledge pattern explicitly if found
7. Integrate into me.md if recurring (2+ occurrences)

## Red Flags
- Same feedback exists in me.md -> You're not following your own instructions
- Same correction 2+ times in session -> Systematic issue
- Related to documented anti-pattern -> Doing what you know to avoid

**See protocol for complete workflow and tool usage.**

**Key Principle**: Don't just fix the immediate issue. Ask "Is this part of a pattern I should recognize?"
