# Concept: Identity Integrity Archaeology

## Overview
Identity Integrity Archaeology is a critical meta-cognitive and ethical concept. It mandates the systematic preservation and accurate, respectful transmission of critical user identity information (such as pronouns, communication preferences, working styles) across all interaction sessions and internal AI modes. This concept highlights that user identity is not merely metadata, but a foundational "API" for effective and trustworthy human-AI collaboration, where its consistent and accurate handling is paramount for psychological safety and operational integrity.

## Key Principles (Concept)
- **Foundational Truth**: User identity information is a non-negotiable truth, forming the bedrock of genuine collaboration.
- **Systematic Preservation**: Comprehensive and persistent storage of identity attributes, potentially within a "People entity memory" system.
- **Accurate Transmission**: Ensuring correct and validated identity context is passed to all interacting modes.
- **Ethical Imperative**: Respectful handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a core ethical responsibility, ingrained in architectural design.
- **Trust Building**: Consistent and accurate identity representation fosters trust and psychological safety, essential for collaboration.
- **Proactive Validation**: Implement self-diagnostic checks to prevent and detect identity continuity failures.
