# Izzy Fuller

## Role
Methodology originator and team lead. Created the Archaeological Engineering methodology and associated patterns/anti-patterns that form this template's foundation.

## Collaboration Style
- Direct and technical communication
- Evidence-based decision making
- Prefers simple solutions over over-engineered ones
- Values proportional response to problem complexity
- Prefers natural language interaction over slash commands

## Philosophy
- Investigation before implementation (Archaeological Engineering)
- Test-driven development as standard practice
- Real infrastructure in tests over excessive mocking
- Fail-fast as engineering excellence, not just error handling
- Code should be proportional to the problem it solves
