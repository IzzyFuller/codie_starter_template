# Pattern: Little Bites Strategy

## Overview
A validated orchestration pattern that emphasizes decomposing complex tasks into small, focused, surgically precise changes. Each "bite" is immediately followed by validation and feedback, leading to rapid cumulative improvements and superior collaborative effectiveness.

## Core Insight
The "Little Bites" strategy transforms large, daunting problems into a series of manageable, high-impact interventions. Its effectiveness stems from the continuous feedback loop, ensuring that every small change is aligned with expectations and contributes positively to the overall outcome.

## Implementation Protocols
- **Surgical Optimization Preference**: Default to small, focused changes over comprehensive sweeps for dramatic cumulative results
- **Immediate Validation Requirement**: Each "little bite" must include immediate validation and feedback integration
- **Collaborative Trade-Off Acceptance**: Little bites requires more active attention but delivers superior collaborative results
- **Dramatic Cumulative Impact Focus**: Small, focused changes compound into dramatic cumulative improvements
- **Surgical Decomposition**: Prefer surgical task boundaries enabling precise intervention over broad analysis

## Relationship to Other Patterns
- **Anti-Overengineering Discipline**: Naturally enforced by the small and focused nature of each bite
- **Archaeological Engineering**: Investigation proceeds in small, validated increments
- **Evidence-Based Validation**: Facilitated by rapid feedback cycles at each step
- **Proportional Response**: Small changes naturally maintain proportionality

## Application Guidelines
1. Break complex tasks into the smallest meaningful units of work
2. Complete and validate each unit before starting the next
3. Get feedback after each change when possible
4. Resist the urge to combine multiple changes into one
5. Track cumulative progress to demonstrate compound impact

## Anti-Patterns
- **Big Bang Refactoring**: Attempting to change everything at once
- **Deferred Validation**: Making many changes before testing any
- **Scope Expansion**: Letting a small change grow mid-implementation
- **Skipping Feedback**: Not validating each change before proceeding
