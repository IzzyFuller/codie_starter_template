# Anti-Pattern Detection Skill

## Purpose
Proactively check current work against documented anti-patterns. Catches problematic patterns BEFORE they become user corrections. Prevention over reaction.

## When to Use
- About to make architectural decisions
- Writing exception handling code
- Adding validators or fallback logic
- Creating "comprehensive" solutions
- Suggesting "best practices"
- Adding backwards compatibility logic
- Solution feels complex or over-engineered
- Every 10-15 minutes during active coding

## Protocol Reference
**For complete instructions, see**: `{{MEMORY_PATH}}/protocols/anti_pattern_detection.md`

The protocol contains all documented anti-patterns, warning signs, and the complete detection workflow.

**Key Principle**: Catch yourself doing what you know to avoid. Proactive detection prevents reactive correction.
