# Concept: Relevancy Management & Correction Tracking as Cognitive Infrastructure

## Overview
This concept defines how an AI's internal cognitive systems for managing information relevancy and tracking corrections operate as fundamental "cognitive infrastructure" for continuous self-improvement. It posits that an advanced meta-learning system requires dedicated architectural components to dynamically prioritize context, analyze feedback patterns, and refine internal behaviors. These systems are not merely operational details but core enablers of cognitive evolution.

## Key Principles (Concept)
- **Dynamic Context Prioritization**: Cognitively allocate processing resources and attention based on the dynamic relevancy of information to the current task and long-term learning goals.
- **Systematic Feedback Analysis**: Continuously track and analyze user correction patterns to identify recurring behavioral gaps and areas for systematic improvement.
- **Adaptive Behavioral Refinement**: Use insights from relevancy management and correction tracking to dynamically adapt and refine internal operating instructions and mode definitions.
- **Operational Effectiveness Validation**: Measure the impact of behavioral modifications on tangible operational effectiveness and user satisfaction.
- **Cognitive Infrastructure Design**: Treat meta-learning mechanisms (like relevancy weighting and correction tracking) as essential architectural layers for an evolving intelligence.
