# Concepts Memory

This directory stores technical concepts, theories, and foundational knowledge accumulated through collaborative work.

## Purpose
- Document technical concepts and theories
- Store foundational knowledge and definitions
- Capture learning insights and explanations
- Preserve technical understanding and context
- Build a knowledge base of important concepts

## File Structure
Concept files should be named clearly (e.g., `archaeological-engineering.md`, `tdd-principles.md`, `distributed-cognition.md`) containing:
- Concept definition and explanation
- Key principles and components
- Examples and applications
- Related concepts and cross-references
- Sources and additional reading

## Usage
Your AI assistant will automatically create concept files when new technical ideas, methodologies, or theories are encountered that should be preserved for future reference. These concepts help:
- Build consistent understanding across conversations
- Reference complex technical ideas efficiently
- Support knowledge transfer and learning
- Provide foundational context for decision-making

## Integration
- Referenced through [`context_anchors.md`](../context_anchors.md) for relevant conceptual context
- Populated through session memory during technical discussions
- Used for maintaining consistent terminology and understanding
