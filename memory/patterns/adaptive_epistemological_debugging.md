# Pattern: Adaptive Epistemological Debugging Methodology

## Overview
This methodology describes an adaptive debugging strategy that balances archaeological thoroughness with focused efficiency based on the confidence level of the problem's origin. It prevents "boiling the ocean" when surgical precision is more appropriate, ensuring efficient resource allocation and truth-seeking.

## Key Principles
- **Confidence Level Assessment**: Before debugging, assess confidence based on recent intentional changes, known modification patterns, test failure alignment, and project context.
- **High Confidence Debugging**: For known recent changes in specific files, target debugging to modified files and known change scope, integrating recent change context to prevent broad codebase investigation.
- **Low Confidence Debugging**: For mysterious failures with unknown root causes, apply systematic codebase investigation using Archaeological Engineering methodology, including comprehensive scope analysis.
- **Scope Balance Enforcement**: Delegate debugging tasks with project context and confidence level to prevent inappropriate scope expansion.
- **Efficiency in Truth-Seeking**: The path to truth is adaptively chosen, championing strategic depth over uniform thoroughness.
