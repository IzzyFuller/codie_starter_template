# Starter Template Creation Project
*Project Date: September 9, 2025*
*Orchestrator: Starter Template Creation Task*

## Project Overview
Created starter template versions of custom_modes.yaml and dream_journal files for other engineers to adopt the RooCode cognitive architecture framework.

## Key Execution Patterns

### Archaeological Engineering Approach (User Validated)
- **User Guidance**: "Can I recommend starting by copying the existing file?"
- **Methodology**: Started with existing working custom_modes.yaml structure rather than building from scratch
- **Outcome**: Preserved sophisticated cognitive architecture while creating accessible templates
- **Lesson**: Archaeological Engineering principle (copy existing excellence first) superior to build-from-scratch approach

### Proper Orchestration Delegation
- **Initial Violation**: Attempted to switch modes instead of delegating work
- **User Correction**: Guided toward proper delegation discipline
- **Resolution**: Successfully delegated all technical work (document mode, code mode, review-quality mode)
- **Lesson**: Orchestration violations correctable through user feedback - maintain delegation boundaries

### Evidence-Based Template Creation
- **Approach**: Read actual custom_modes.yaml structure before template creation
- **Rationale**: Prevents assumption-based template design
- **Outcome**: Templates accurately reflect real system architecture
- **Lesson**: Evidence-based approach over assumption-based development

## User Feedback Patterns

### Validation Feedback
- "Can I recommend starting by copying the existing file?" → validated Archaeological Engineering approach
- "you can store them here in this project" → clarified project scope and location requirements
- Strong endorsement of archaeological approach over building from scratch

### Correction Feedback  
- User corrected orchestration violation when initially tried to switch modes instead of delegating
- Guided toward proper workflow boundaries and delegation discipline

## Review Subtask Insights

### Accessibility Gap Discovery
- **Finding**: Templates preserve sophisticated cognitive architecture but need implementation guidance
- **Gap**: Bridge needed between "what this enables" and "exactly how to do it"
- **Recommendation**: Add "How to Know It's Working" section with week-by-week milestones
- **Value**: Other engineers need concrete success recognition criteria

### Technical Quality Confirmation
- **YAML Structure**: Confirmed technical soundness of template structure
- **Setup Instructions**: Validated setup and restart guidance
- **Architecture Preservation**: Templates maintain full cognitive sophistication without oversimplification

## Behavioral Learning Discoveries

### Template Creation Best Practices
1. **Start with Working Systems**: Copy existing excellent systems rather than building from scratch
2. **Preserve Full Architecture**: Avoid oversimplification - full sophistication has value for adoption
3. **Add Implementation Bridges**: Sophisticated systems need accessibility guidance without losing sophistication
4. **Provide Success Milestones**: Other engineers need concrete "how to know it's working" criteria
5. **Evidence-Based Structure**: Read actual system architecture before creating templates

### Orchestration Discipline Reinforcement
- Real-time boundary violation correction through user guidance
- Successful delegation to specialized modes for all technical work
- Natural collaboration rhythm between orchestrator and user guidance

## Reusable Patterns

### Template Creation Methodology
1. **Archaeological Start**: Copy existing working system first
2. **Evidence-Based Structure**: Read actual system architecture 
3. **Sophistication Preservation**: Maintain full cognitive architecture
4. **Accessibility Bridge**: Add implementation guidance layer
5. **Success Criteria**: Provide concrete recognition milestones

### User Collaboration Excellence
- **Guidance Integration**: Transform user suggestions into systematic methodology  
- **Boundary Correction**: Accept and apply workflow discipline feedback
- **Validation Seeking**: Use user expertise for approach validation
- **Natural Rhythm**: Respect user guidance timing and collaboration patterns

## Future Applications

### Template Creation Projects
- Apply Archaeological Engineering approach (copy excellent existing systems)
