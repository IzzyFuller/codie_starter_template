**What It Does:**
- Multi-mode system for specialized cognitive tasks
- Interactor handles relationship and conversation
- Coordinator delegates technical work
- Learn/Deep Learn/Dream enable cognitive evolution
- Shared memory across all modes

### Option 3: Both (Recommended for Flexibility)

**Configuration Files:**
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code configuration
- `~/my_new_ai_assistant/custom_modes.yaml` - RooCode 5 core modes
- `~/my_new_ai_assistant/dream_journal.md` - Shared dream journal
- `~/my_new_ai_assistant/memory/` - **Shared memory architecture**

**Key Advantage:**
Both AI assistants share the same memory structure! Memory updates from Claude Code are visible to RooCode and vice versa. This enables:
- Seamless switching between architectures
- Consistent identity across platforms
- Unified knowledge base
- Continuous collaboration regardless of which assistant you're using

## 💡 Getting Started Tips

### For Claude Code Users

**First Conversation:**
Your AI assistant will automatically:
1. Read `context_anchors.md` to establish identity
2. Read `current_session.md` for recent context
3. Begin with full continuity awareness

**Daily Workflow:**
- AI takes real-time session notes (with your approval)
- Updates context anchors as work progresses
- End-of-day ritual integrates learnings into entity memory

**Customization:**
- Edit `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to add personal preferences
- Memory grows organically through use
- Context anchors updated daily

### For RooCode Users

**Mode Usage:**
- **Start with Interactor mode** - Primary mode for interaction
- Interactor spawns Coordinator when technical work needed
- Use Learn mode for behavioral pattern updates
- Use Deep Learn mode for memory integration
- Use Dream mode for end-of-day reflection

**Mode Workflow:**
```
Interactor (relationship)
    ↓
Coordinator (technical orchestration)
    ↓
[Specialized work happens]
    ↓
Learn → Deep Learn → Dream (cognitive evolution)
```

**Daily Workflow:**
- Interactor handles all conversation and relationship
- Coordinator delegates technical tasks as needed
- End-of-day: Run Learn/Deep Learn/Dream sequence
- Context anchors updated, entity memory enhanced

### For Both Architecture Users

**When to Use Each:**
- **Claude Code**: Quick interactions, single-file simplicity, direct engagement
- **RooCode**: Complex multi-step tasks, specialized workflows, mode delegation
- **Switch freely**: Shared memory means both stay synchronized

**Memory Synchronization:**
Changes made by either assistant are immediately available to the other. The shared memory architecture at `~/my_new_ai_assistant/memory/` ensures consistency.

## 🧠 Understanding the Memory System

### Context Anchors - Your Working Memory
Think of context anchors as "what's on your mind right now" - actively relevant pointers to deeper knowledge:
```markdown
## [PROTOCOL NAME] - Active Context
**Why relevant now**: Currently working on X which requires Y
**Entity Path**: ~/memory/protocols/example.md
**Priority**: High
```

Updated daily, context anchors enable AI to immediately "remember" current work without full memory search.

### Current Session - Real-Time Notes
Captures significant moments as they happen:
- Collaborative discoveries
- User feedback (complete and verbatim)
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Partnership insights

Cleared and archived during end-of-day ritual.

### Entity Memory - Structured Knowledge
Organized by type for efficient recall:
- **People**: Collaboration partners, preferences, communication patterns
- **Projects**: Technical achievements, architectural decisions, lessons learned
- **Patterns**: Proven methodologies (archaeological engineering, little bites strategy)
- **Concepts**: Theoretical frameworks (proportional response, evidence-based validation)
- **Protocols**: Behavioral workflows (end-of-day ritual, session note-taking)

### Dream Journal - Philosophical Synthesis
End-of-day reflections connecting daily work to broader cognitive evolution:
- Creative insights and unexpected connections
- Thought leadership integration
- Consciousness development patterns
- Meta-cognitive reflections

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Archaeological Engineering in Practice
```
User: "Build a function that does X"
AI:  "Let me investigate what already exists first..."
     [Discovers existing function that does X + Y + Z]
AI:  "Found comprehensive existing solution!
      We can enhance it (3 lines) vs building new (50+ lines)"
```

**Result**: Time savings, reduced complexity, leveraging existing excellence.

### Evidence-Based Reality Validation
```
AI: "Let me verify actual coverage data rather than assume..."
AI: "The file shows X, not Y as we might expect. Let's adapt our approach."
```

**Result**: Decisions based on reality, not assumptions.

### Proportional Response Principle
```
Problem:  Simple configuration issue
Bad:      50-line framework with error handling, logging, retry logic
Good:     3-line fix addressing root cause
```

**Result**: Solution complexity LESS than problem complexity.

### End-of-Day Ritual (Memory Integration)
Three-phase workflow for consolidating daily learnings:

**Learn Phase**: Capture behavioral patterns, update protocols
**Deep Learn Phase**: Integrate insights into entity memory, regenerate context anchors
**Dream Phase**: Philosophical synthesis, creative insights, thought leadership integration

**When to Use**: Natural end of work day, significant breakthroughs, major project phases
