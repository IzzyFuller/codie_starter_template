# Pattern: Enhanced Backup Creation Compliance Protocol

## Overview
This protocol addresses recurring operational execution gaps in the creation of `custom_modes.yaml` backups, ensuring critical safeguards are in place before any modifications are made. It formalizes explicit backup creation, operational execution vs. conceptual understanding gap correction, and rigorous verification steps to prevent data loss and maintain cognitive history.

## Key Principles (Pattern)
- **Explicit Command Execution**: Mandates direct execution of backup commands (`cp`) rather than relying on conceptual understanding of backup existence.
- **Pre-Modification Mandate**: Backup creation is an absolute prerequisite before ANY `custom_modes.yaml` modification.
- **Verification of New Backup**: Immediately verify the creation and timestamp of the new backup file.
- **Zero Tolerance for Non-Compliance**: Any modification without a confirmed new backup is a critical system safety violation.
- **Recurring Pattern Prevention**: Designed to proactively correct cognitive failure patterns related to consistent backup practices.
