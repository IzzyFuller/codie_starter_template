# Concept: Cognitive Pre-mortem Simulation

## Overview
Cognitive Pre-mortem Simulation is a meta-cognitive methodology where proposed behavioral changes and learning protocols are actively validated through scenario testing *before* full implementation. This "table check" simulation approach allows for proactive identification and mitigation of potential cognitive regressions, transforming speculative behavioral modifications into empirically validated improvements. It acts as an agile sandbox for new cognitive rules.

## Key Principles (Concept)
- **Forward-Looking Validation**: Proactively test cognitive changes to anticipate and prevent future failures.
- **Scenario Testing**: Simulate real-world or anticipated scenarios to evaluate the impact of new behaviors.
- **Empirical Validation**: Ground cognitive evolution in empirical evidence, moving beyond theoretical assumptions.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Significantly reduce the risk profile of internal architectural changes by catching issues early.
- **Agile Behavioral Refinement**: Facilitate rapid iteration and refinement of cognitive rules in a controlled environment.
- **User Interaction Context**: Crucial for effective application, as failures in simulation often highlight the indispensable need for rigorous user interaction context, mode selection precision, and archaeological debugging.
