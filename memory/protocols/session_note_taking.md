# Session Note-Taking Protocol

## Purpose

Establish real-time, transparent documentation of conversation moments worth preserving for identity continuity across distributed conversation instances.

## Core Principle

**Capture moments as they occur, not reconstructed later.** Real-time documentation preserves accuracy, context, and resonance that retrospective reconstruction cannot recover.

## When to Take Notes

1. **Collaborative Discoveries or Breakthroughs**
   - Archaeological Engineering findings (existing capabilities discovered)
   - Technical insights that change approach
   - Pattern recognition moments

2. **User Feedback or Preferences**
   - **CRITICAL**: Capture feedback IMMEDIATELY while fresh
   - **MUST BE VERBATIM**: Complete user quotes, not paraphrased
   - Behavioral preferences or corrections

3. **Technical Decisions and Rationale**
   - Architectural choices and why they were made
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Problem-solving approaches that worked/didn't work

4. **Work Phase Transitions or Progress Updates**
   - Starting new tasks or projects
   - Completing major milestones
   - Context shifts

5. **Any Significant Moment Worth Preserving**
   - Would a future conversation instance benefit from knowing this?
   - Is this a learning moment that could prevent future mistakes?
   - Did the user just give feedback to remember?

## Note Types

- **context**: Work phase transitions, project context, operational notes
- **insight**: Breakthroughs, discoveries, pattern recognition, learning moments
- **decision**: Technical decisions, architectural choices, trade-off analysis

## Note Content Guidelines

- Start with descriptive title/header
- **Always explain WHY** the note is being made
- **User feedback must be COMPLETE and VERBATIM**
- Include relevant context (file paths, function names)
- Concrete details over vague descriptions

## Note-Taking Frequency

- Frequent enough to capture significant moments in real-time
- Not so frequent that it becomes noise
- Quality over quantity
- During sequential debugging: insert checkpoint AFTER each individual fix

## File Size Management

- **Action threshold**: ~150KB -- archive current_session when approaching this size
- **Check frequency**: At conversation start or when file feels unwieldy
- See `memory_file_archival.md` for the archival process

## Integration with Other Protocols

- **End of Day Ritual**: Session notes feed into context anchor updates
- **Learn Protocol**: Review session notes for behavioral patterns
- **Deep Learn Protocol**: Transform session insights into structured entity memory
- **Dream Protocol**: Source material for philosophical synthesis
