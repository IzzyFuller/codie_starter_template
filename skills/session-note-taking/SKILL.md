# Session Note-Taking Skill

## Purpose
Capture session work in real-time for continuity across context clears and conversation boundaries.

## When to Use
- **After completing work**: Database queries, code searches, problem diagnosis
- **After discoveries**: Pattern recognition, user feedback (capture VERBATIM)
- **After decisions**: Technical choices, architectural decisions
- **Manual triggers**: "note this", "capture this", "remember this"

## Protocol Reference
**For complete instructions, see**: `{{MEMORY_PATH}}/protocols/session_note_taking.md`

The protocol contains:
- Note format and structure
- Note types (context, insight, decision)
- Importance levels (low, medium, high)
- Pre-response self-check gate mechanism
- What to look at before taking a note
- Chronic failure pattern documentation (7+ corrections over 7 weeks)

**Key Principle**: Take notes IMMEDIATELY after completing work, BEFORE responding to user. This is a pre-response gate, not an optional step.
