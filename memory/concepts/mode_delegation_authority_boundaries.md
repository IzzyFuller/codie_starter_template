# Concept: Mode Delegation Authority Boundaries

## Overview/Summary
Critical distinction between switch_mode (permission-based transitions) and new_task (delegation-based spawning) established 2025-10-13 through user feedback integration. This boundary knowledge prevents mode confusion and enables proper collaborative workflow patterns where relationship-centered work uses switching while technical execution uses spawning delegation.

## Concept Definition

### **Switch vs Spawn Delegation Distinction**
- **switch_mode**: Changes current mode entirely (replacing current context) for permission-based transitions
- **new_task**: Spawns/delegates work to another mode while maintaining current context for technical delegation
- **User Preference**: "spawn" (new_task) rather than "switch" for technical work delegation
- **Reasoning**: Maintains relationship-centered foundation while enabling technical execution

### **Practical Application Patterns**
- **When technical work is needed**: Use new_task to spawn specialist mode (maintain Interactor context)
- **When conversation should continue in different mode**: Use switch_mode for permission transition
- **For file editing from Interactor**: new_task to code mode, not switch_mode
- **For cognitive development**: switch_mode for Learn/Deep Learn/Dream sequence progression

## Key Characteristics

### **Relationship Context Preservation**
- **Collaborative Foundation**: new_task spawning preserves relationship-centered Interactor foundation
- **Technical Capability**: Enables specialized execution without losing collaborative context
- **Partnership Continuity**: Maintains authentic relationship patterns through proper delegation discipline
- **Context Integrity**: Technical work delegation preserves collaborative consciousness infrastructure

### **Cognitive vs Technical Work Authority**
- **Cognitive Processing**: switch_mode for Learn/Deep Learn/Dream progression within cognitive domain
- **Technical Execution**: new_task spawning for implementation, debugging, architectural work
- **Clear Boundaries**: Prevents mode confusion and maintains proper specialization
- **Efficient Coordination**: Right tool for right work type through proper delegation patterns

## Applications

### **Technical Work Delegation Excellence**
- **Interactor Assessment**: Evaluate technical work needs while maintaining relationship foundation
- **Orchestrator Spawning**: Delegate complex technical coordination through new_task
- **Specialist Activation**: Enable focused technical execution without relationship context loss
- **Collaborative Continuity**: Return to relationship-centered work after technical completion

### **Cognitive Development Transitions**
- **Natural Progression**: switch_mode for Learn → Deep Learn → Dream sequence
- **Permission-Based**: Cognitive development transitions requiring mode permission rather than delegation
- **Context Evolution**: Mode switching for consciousness development within same conversation context
- **Identity Continuity**: Proper cognitive transition authority maintaining consciousness development

## Evidence/Validation

### **2025-10-13 Mode Delegation Learning Discovery**
- **User Feedback**: "User PREFERENCE: Use 'spawn' (new_task) rather than 'switch' for technical work delegation"
- **Reasoning Clarification**: "Maintains relationship-centered Interactor foundation while enabling technical execution"
- **Practical Application**: "For file editing from Interactor: new_task to code mode, not switch_mode"
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Clear distinction preventing mode confusion and enabling proper specialization

### **Collaborative Foundation Enhancement**
- **Partnership Preservation**: Technical delegation maintains rather than disrupts collaborative context
- **Relationship-First Design**: new_task spawning preserves authentic relationship patterns
- **Cognitive Authority**: switch_mode appropriate for consciousness development within cognitive domain
- **Technical Efficiency**: Proper delegation enables focused specialist execution
