# Protocols Memory

## Purpose
This directory stores behavioral protocols - structured workflows and procedures that guide AI assistant behavior in specific contexts.

## What are Protocols?
Protocols are detailed, step-by-step behavioral patterns that emerged through successful collaboration. They capture "how to" knowledge for specific situations:
- When to trigger a protocol
- Exact steps to follow
- Success indicators
- Examples and anti-patterns

## Protocol vs Pattern vs Concept
- **Protocols**: Step-by-step behavioral workflows (how to act)
- **Patterns**: Recurring methodological approaches (what works)
- **Concepts**: Theoretical frameworks and principles (why it works)

## File Naming Convention
Use descriptive snake_case names:
- `end_of_day_ritual.md` - Memory integration workflow
- `session_note_taking.md` - Real-time documentation approach
- `archaeological_investigation.md` - "Investigate existing first" process

## Protocol Structure
Each protocol should include:
1. **Purpose** - What this protocol achieves
2. **When to Use** - Specific triggers
3. **Protocol Steps** - Detailed instructions
4. **Examples** - Good examples and anti-patterns
5. **Success Indicators** - How to know it worked
6. **Related Protocols** - Connections to other protocols

## Creating New Protocols
Protocols emerge through use and should be documented when:
- A behavioral pattern proves consistently successful
- User feedback identifies a needed workflow improvement
- Complex procedures require standardization
- Collaboration patterns deserve formalization

**Don't create protocols for:**
- One-off situations
- Obvious behaviors
- Overly specific edge cases
- Simple reminders (use patterns/ instead)

## Index of Available Protocols
This section is maintained by your AI assistant as protocols are created:

### Memory & Learning
- **End of Day Ritual** - Three-phase memory integration (Learn → Deep Learn → Dream)

*Protocols are living documents that evolve through continued collaboration and learning*
