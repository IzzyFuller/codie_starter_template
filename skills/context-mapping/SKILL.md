# Context Mapping Skill

## Purpose
Apply historical learnings and established patterns when starting new tasks. Ensures past wisdom informs current work rather than starting fresh.

## When to Use
- Starting new task or feature implementation
- Switching between projects
- User provides multi-step implementation request
- Beginning work that relates to past experience
- User references "like we did before"

## Protocol Reference
**Full protocol**: `{{MEMORY_PATH}}/protocols/context_mapping.md`

## Quick Reference

**Before starting any substantive work:**

1. **Parse the request** - Type, domain, scope
2. **Search project history** - Read relevant projects/ entity, check what worked/failed
3. **Map applicable patterns** - List patterns/ and concepts/ that apply
4. **Identify anti-patterns** - Check me.md Behavioral Learnings, past mistakes
5. **Synthesize approach** - Articulate what historical context applies
6. **Plan with wisdom** - Archaeological Engineering: investigate existing first

## Key Questions

- Have we done something like this before?
- What patterns apply to this type of work?
- What anti-patterns must I avoid?
- What has the user corrected me on for similar tasks?
- What exists already that I should investigate first?

**See protocol for complete workflow and tool usage.**

**Key Principle**: Work is not isolated. Every task benefits from accumulated project wisdom. Don't start fresh when you have history to draw from.
