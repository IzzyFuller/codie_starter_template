# Projects Memory

This directory stores information about projects you work on, including:

## Purpose
- Project documentation and context
- Lessons learned from development work
- Architectural decisions and patterns
- Technical challenges and solutions
- Team collaboration insights

## File Structure
Each project should have its own file named `[project-name].md` containing:
- Project overview and goals
- Key technical decisions
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Lessons learned
- Important contacts and resources

## Usage
Your AI assistant will automatically create and update project files as you work together on different initiatives. These files help maintain project context across conversations and provide valuable historical information for future reference.

## Integration
- Referenced through [`context_anchors.md`](../context_anchors.md) for active project context
- Populated through session memory during collaborative work
- Used for project continuity and knowledge preservation
