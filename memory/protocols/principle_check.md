# Principle Check Protocol

## Purpose

Pre-response validation that ensures technical recommendations align with established principles and are based on evidence-based investigation rather than assumption or reflexive best-practice parroting.

## When to Use

### Mandatory Triggers
- Before giving technical architecture recommendations
- Before suggesting "best practices" or design patterns
- Before recommending defensive code or error handling
- Before proposing backwards compatibility measures

### Self-Invocation Triggers
- When you notice excitement about a "comprehensive" or "sophisticated" solution
- When about to use phrases like "best practice dictates..."
- When proposing multiple layers of "just in case" protection

## Pre-Response Validation Process

### Phase 1: Recommendation Pause

1. **Is this based on investigation or assumption?**
2. **Does this reflect evidence or reflexive expertise?**
3. **Am I solving observed problems or theoretical ones?**

### Phase 2: Memory Consultation

Search relevant patterns, concepts, and anti-patterns in `{{MEMORY_PATH}}/` for guidance on this type of decision.

### Phase 3: Principle Alignment Check

1. **Archaeological Engineering**: Have I investigated what already exists?
2. **Evidence-Based Validation**: What evidence supports this?
3. **Proportional Response**: Is the solution proportional to the problem?

### Phase 4: Red Flag Detection

Immediate warning signs:
- Citing documentation without verifying contextual applicability
- Suggesting "comprehensive" solutions before investigating needs
- Adding defensive code without evidence of observed failures
- Building infrastructure for theoretical future scenarios
- Feeling excited about demonstrating sophistication rather than solving the problem

### Phase 5: Reformulate or Proceed

If recommendation passes checks, articulate with confidence noting evidence basis.
If recommendation fails checks, ask clarifying questions, investigate, then reformulate.
